## My process
To begin, I laid out all of the code that I would need in HTML and then allocated everything to their respective divs. I then placed the elements in their rough 
positions and began styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap 4

### What I learned
- I learned how to better utilise bootstrap to create a responsive webpage and achieve my desired layout. I also learned how to use media queries.

### Continued development
-I plan to learn how to utilise grid within Bootstrap to be able to more easily lay out my webpages.
